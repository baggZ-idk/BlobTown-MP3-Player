# BlobTown-MP3-Player
### By: baggZ
Note: DDD_Dev(an admin) said i could make this. This is allowed by the game to use.

## Info
I'm making this so people can play music whilst making things in BlobTown. This adds a Music tab to the inventory

## Installation
Put the global-metadata.dat file into Android/data/app.RevelVR.blobtown/files/il2cpp/metadata via shizuku or usb-debugging.
